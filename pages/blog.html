            <p class="blog-text">A comprehensive guide to acing technical interviews by mastering core data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving strategies used by top tech companies.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="blog-modal-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>Preparing for software engineering interviews can be daunting, but mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is the key to success. This article explores the most important concepts, strategies, and resources to help you excel in coding interviews.</p>
            <p><strong>Why DSA Matters:</strong> DSA forms the backbone of problem-solving in computer science. Interviewers use DSA questions to assess your analytical thinking, coding skills, and ability to optimize solutions. Understanding arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, and hash tables is essential.</p>
            <p><strong>Core Topics to Cover:</strong><br>
            • <strong>Arrays & Strings:</strong> Manipulation, searching, sorting, and sliding window techniques.<br>
            • <strong>Linked Lists:</strong> Reversal, cycle detection, and merging.<br>
            • <strong>Trees & Graphs:</strong> Traversals (BFS, DFS), shortest path, and dynamic programming on trees.<br>
            • <strong>Stacks & Queues:</strong> Expression evaluation, monotonic stacks, and queue-based algorithms.<br>
            • <strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Memoization, tabulation, and optimization patterns.<br>
            • <strong>Sorting & Searching:</strong> Binary search, quicksort, mergesort, and custom comparators.</p>
            <p><strong>Interview Strategies:</strong> Practice with platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces. Focus on understanding patterns rather than memorizing solutions. Use whiteboarding to communicate your thought process clearly. Time yourself to simulate real interview conditions.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Pitfalls:</strong> Avoid overcomplicating solutions. Always consider edge cases and test your code. Don't neglect space and time complexity analysis.</p>
            <p><strong>Final Tips:</strong> Consistent practice, mock interviews, and peer discussions will boost your confidence. Remember, interviews are as much about problem-solving as they are about communication and collaboration. With dedication and the right approach, you can master DSA and land your dream job.</p>

            <p class="blog-text">Discover how Docker simplifies machine learning workflows, ensuring consistency from development to deployment in production environments.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="blog-modal-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>Machine learning projects often suffer from environment inconsistencies, dependency hell, and deployment headaches. Docker solves these challenges by providing a consistent, reproducible environment for every stage of the ML pipeline.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Use Docker for ML?</strong> Docker containers encapsulate your code, dependencies, and system libraries, ensuring that your model runs the same way everywhere. This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem and accelerates collaboration between data scientists and engineers.</p>
            <p><strong>Pipeline Stages:</strong><br>
            • <strong>Data Ingestion:</strong> Use Docker to run ETL jobs, preprocess data, and manage data versioning.<br>
            • <strong>Model Training:</strong> Containerize training scripts with all required libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).<br>
            • <strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Run tests and validation in isolated containers.<br>
            • <strong>Deployment:</strong> Package models as REST APIs using Flask, FastAPI, or Django, and deploy with Docker Compose or Kubernetes.</p>
            <p><strong>Best Practices:</strong> Use multi-stage builds to keep images lean. Store configuration in environment variables. Automate builds with CI/CD pipelines. Monitor containers with tools like Prometheus and Grafana.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Docker empowers ML teams to build, test, and deploy models faster and more reliably. By mastering Docker, you'll streamline your workflow and deliver robust, production-ready ML solutions.</p>
